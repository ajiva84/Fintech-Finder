# Technologies

Python is the primary language used to code this application. Streamlit library is utilized to provide a web interface. Dataclass and Typing libraries are used to create dataclass and input manipulations. Finally, Web3 and Ganache libraries used to interact with mock Ethereum blockchain and to record transactions.

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started) - Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps
* [DataClasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) - It provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding generated special methods 
* [Typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) -  This module provides runtime support for type hints
* [Hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms (e.g., SHA256)
